## UX

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### User Stories

- #### Things are slowly getting back to normal due to the pandemic, I want to plan my next holiday

1. I want to easily navigate the site relatively easily

2. I want to be able to see a balance of text, images and some video to get a glimpse of where I will be visiting

3. I want to be able to access links that direct me to important websites easily

4. I want some clicking interaction with the page so that I don't get bored

- #### As a previous who is using the website for reference

1. I want to have access to the website on any device and on the go

2. I want the navigation bar easily accessible so that I can get where I want quickly

### Design

All wireframes, mockups and prototypes were created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com) and were inspired from
The website design was inspired by the online stores [ASOS](https://www.asos.com/women/), [The Perfume Shop](https://www.theperfumeshop.com) and [The Fragrance Shop](https://www.thefragranceshop.co.uk)

#### Wireframes

Each device will have a total of 8 distinct pages. All other components will be created from existing components in the pages. The wireframes follow the mobile first design and also follow the essential user stories.

##### _Homepage_

The homepage of each device be mostly identical. The exceptions will the image and name cards that are arranged into two rows for the mobile wireframe and one row for tablet and desktop wireframes. The search bar will be in its own section in the mobile and tablet wireframes. The search bar in the desktop version will on the header. The header will have the user icons The grey bar is the promotion banner.

##### _Product Detail_

The product pages for each device will again be mostly identical. The mobile view will display each element in a list. The order will be the product title, product image, buttons, product content and lastly, product details. The tablet and desktop will follow the same order however the product image will be large and floated on the left and the product title, buttons and product content will be floated right. the product details will be placed below the two sections.

<img src="README/wireframes/mobile/img/product-detail-mobile.png" height="300" /> <img src="README/wireframes/tablet/img/product-detail-tablet.png" height="300" /> <img src="README/wireframes/desktop/img/product-detail-desktop.png" height="300" />

##### _Basket_

The shopping basket page will again be very similar and follow the same format and style. The product image will be floated on the left and the product details on the page. The user also has the option to remove, and just the quantity of the product on this page before going to the checkout page.

<img src="README/wireframes/mobile/img/basket-mobile.png" height="300" /> <img src="README/wireframes/tablet/img/basket-tablet.png" height="300" /> <img src="README/wireframes/desktop/img/basket-desktop.png" height="300" />

##### _Checkout_

The checkout page will have a progress meter so user know what and how many forms they will need to complete on all displays. The mobile and tablet views of the checkout page will show the basket via a prompt with a button. On the desktop version the basket will be shown on the right side as a result of more space. Redirection to edit the basket will be on this page.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

### Existing Features

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

#### Common Features Across All Pages

- [x] **Header** - allows user to easily navigate across all pages

- Header is fixed to top of page for easy access (desktop and large tablets)
- Zimbabwe logo and text are positioned on the left and are links that take you to the homepage
- Navigation is place on the right on the logo for easy access (under logo for mobile)
- Navigation links change colour when hovered over. This lets the visitor know that it is clickable.
- Navigation link is underlined to let user know what page they are on
- Entire header disappears for mobile devices
- Colors have been chosen with optimum contrast in mind to be pleasant to the eye.
- [x] **Links** that are hovered over
- All links that are surrounding text have been underlined and change color when hovered over. This helps the user to identify external links. (except logo)
- [x] **Navigation banner**
- Navigation banner is the same across all pages to give uniformity and familiarity
- background image on home is scrollable to give a more fun user experience
- [x] **Accessibility**
- All images have aria labels in case they don't load and for the visually impaired
- [x] **Buttons**
- All buttons have the same styling and they invert colours when hovered (except for scroll to top button)
- [x] **Responsiveness**
- All pages work well with many screen sizes
- [x] **Footer**
- Footer sticks to the bottom of the page, regardless of the amount of content. This aids the overall user experience.
- All content have near uniform layout to give a nice and engaging flow of text and images
- Social links have been grouped together
- 'Contact us' is form for feedback and any question the user might have

### Specific to Pages

- [x] **Home Page**

- Image grid to easily see a handful of places the user can visit. When the mouse hovers you get addition information about the location

### Features Left to Implement

- Add a page where you can make a booking for a particular destinations. this includes adding a virtual online basket so that users can see what they have already selected (requires **Javascript** knowledge) For this reason I decided to remove the booking page from the website because it would be too incomplete and not provide a positive user experience.

- hide the scroll to top button at the beginning of page

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:

- Go to the "Contact Us" page
- Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
- Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
- Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

- ### Navigation bar

- When the logo or text is clicked, the user is redirected to the home page
- All links are working and have been tested.
- navigation bar is aligned vertically and under the logo for screens smaller than 660px
